# Awesome-Publish-Subscribe-Pub-Sub-Messaging-Push-Notifications

## Top Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Messaging & Push Notifications Ecosystem



**Curated List of SaaS Products & Open-Source GitHub Projects**  

*Focused on Real-Time Messaging, Multi-Channel Notifications & Self-Hosted Pub/Sub*  

**Last updated: October 2026**



This repository tracks notable **commercial pub/sub and push notification platforms** and **open-source projects** that deliver real-time messages to users across web, mobile, email, SMS, and chat channels — from simple push notifications to sophisticated notification infrastructure.



**Examples** include Amazon SNS, Twilio, OneSignal, Pusher Channels, Firebase Cloud Messaging, Courier, Knock, Novu, Bird (MessageBird), and Sinch (the category leaders).



**Open-source emphasis**: Pub/sub messaging and notifications are strong open-source domains. **Novu** leads as the most comprehensive open-source notification infrastructure. **ntfy**, **Gotify**, and **Apprise** deliver self-hosted push notifications. **Centrifugo** and **Mercure** power real-time pub/sub messaging. **NATS**, **Redis Pub/Sub**, and **Apache Pulsar** provide messaging backbones. **Novu**, **Notifire**, and **Courier** alternatives round out the ecosystem. This section is heavily expanded.

### Additional Strong Open-Source Options



- **Novu** — Complete notification infrastructure .

- **ntfy** — Simple HTTP-based push .

- **Gotify** — Self-hosted push .

- **Apprise** — Multi-service notifications .

- **Centrifugo** — Real-time pub/sub .

**Frameworks for building custom pub/sub and notification solutions**: Combine **Novu** for comprehensive notification infrastructure with multi-channel support . Use **ntfy** or **Gotify** for simple self-hosted push notifications . Deploy **Centrifugo** or **Mercure** for real-time pub/sub messaging . Choose **NATS** for cloud-native messaging . Integrate **Apprise** for multi-service notification routing . Use **web-push** for browser push notifications . Note that true managed notification services with global delivery, delivery analytics, and vendor-supported SLAs (OneSignal, Courier, Knock) remain primarily commercial territory; open-source stacks provide strong notification infrastructure, pub/sub messaging, and push delivery foundations that require integration for complete multi-channel notifications.

## Disclaimer



- This is a **community-curated** list — not exhaustive and not an endorsement.

- Pub/sub and notification platforms handle user data and communication preferences. Self-hosted solutions require proper security hardening, access controls, and compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, CAN-SPAM).

- **Push notification delivery depends on platform providers** — APNs (Apple) and FCM (Google) mediate mobile push. Self-hosted notification platforms still require these services for mobile delivery .

- **Email deliverability requires IP reputation management** — self-hosted email notifications must warm up IPs, configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and monitor blacklists .

- **License considerations**: Novu uses MIT, ntfy uses Apache-2.0/GPL-2.0, Centrifugo uses Apache-2.0, and Mercure uses AGPL-3.0. Verify licensing against your use case before committing .

- The open-source ecosystem provides strong notification infrastructure, pub/sub messaging, and push delivery foundations, but **global delivery, delivery analytics, and vendor-supported SLAs** remain primarily commercial offerings.
